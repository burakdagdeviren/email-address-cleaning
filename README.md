# email-address-cleaning
Cleans and strips PASTED email adress from clipborad for easy copy paste to another email.

USAGE
When you recive a forwarded email message and there are tons of contacts in for forwarded message
to transfer to your new email, copy and pasting all email fields may not always work.

This is because email addresses usually come with attached names etc to them.

In this case, ex. copy all to CC or TO field of the forwarded email from emails body
then run mail.py and paste what you have coppied.

Script will get rid of all the names etc. from the email adresses and print out a clean emails
list with comma as a seperator. Now copy the output from the terminal window and paste it into your
email clients TO/CC filed.
